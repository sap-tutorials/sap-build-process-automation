  - How to create a SAP Build Process Automation project
  - How to create a process that automates sales order creation and approval

## Intro
> **IMPORTANT:** Please refer to sample **Sales Order Management (MI01)** in the SAP Build Store if you face any issues while following the tutorials. To retrieve the sample refer to **step 6** of [Run the Business Process](spa-run-process).

With the new citizen automation user experience, you will get access to a new scope of opportunities for running your day-to-day workflows. In this tutorial, you will learn how a low-code and no-code tool can help you build the apps you need at the speed your business demands, using visual drag and drop tools for application development.

There are many use cases where you can make a difference using SAP Build Process Automation. During this tutorial, you will see how the Sales Order Approval process can be built using forms where a sales order is a document which confirms a sale that is generated by the seller after receiving a purchase order from the buyer. These sale order requests have to be reviewed and approved by the supplier to ensure that the sales orders are delivered on time. Once approved or rejected, the requester will be notified.
