    > **Business Content** provides pre-built business processes for concrete business problems.

    > **Automation SDK** provides all the Software Developments Kits that can be acquired from the store.

You can select one or more filters on the left to filter the available store projects by Project Type (for example Live Process and Business Process), Format Type (for example, Ready to use and Template), Catalog (for example, Business Content), Product (for example, SAP S/4HANA Cloud), Publisher, Line of Business, and Industry.

3. Name the project starting with **Sales Order Management Developer Tutorial** and appending a unique string such as your initials (at least 3 letters).

    >**IMPORTANT:** In a large organization, or large workshop or event, you will have many projects so it is vital to name your project uniquely, as projects much have a unique name.

    Choose **Create**.
