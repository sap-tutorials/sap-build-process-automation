## Intro
With the new citizen automation user experience, you will get access to a new scope of opportunities for running your day-to-day workflows. In this tutorial, you will learn how a low-code and no-code tool can help you build the business process you need at the speed your business demands, using visual drag-and-drop tools for application development.

There are many use cases where you can make a difference using SAP Build Process Automation. During this tutorial, you will see how the Sales Order Approval process can be built using forms where a sales order is a document which confirms a sale that is generated by the seller after receiving a purchase order from the buyer. These sale order requests have to be reviewed and approved by the supplier to ensure that the sales orders are delivered on time. Once approved or rejected, the requester will be notified.

### Create a business process project


1. In the **Lobby**, choose **Create**.

    > The lobby is a central page for creating, accessing, and managing your projects in SAP Build. You can access business application processes, company configured templates, and other resources for your end-to-end business process.

    <!-- border -->![Lobby](001.png)

2. Pick **Build an Automated Process**.

    <!-- border -->![Create a Project](002.png)

3. Select **Business Process**.

    > Business Process Projects are a collection of skills in SAP Build Process Automation. Projects are part of the internal business processes of a company and are defined based on business scenarios. A project can contain a set of processes, forms, automations and decisions, which are reusable artifacts.

    <!-- border -->![9.5](9.5.png)


>Note that the Approval Form will still have an error (red circle with X) because we have not yet configured the Reject path. We will do this later.


### Create and configure Order Rejection Notification through an Email

In this step,you will send out an email notification if the order is rejected.

1. Select the **Approval Form** and add **Mail** to the Rejection node.

    <!-- border -->![Mail_1](Mail_1.png)

2.  Once you have successfully added Mail, let's configure **Mail Header** and **Mail Body**.
    
    In the **To** section, enter the your personal or work email address – **NOT** the email of the user you used to sign into the lobby.

    >Our SAP Build Process Automation is connected to an SMTP (i.e., mail) server and this process will send out a real email, so you want to enter an email address that you can check – **NOT** the email of the user you used to sign into the lobby.

    In the **Subject** section, enter **Order Rejection Notification**.
    
    <!-- border -->![Mail_2](mail_2.png)   

3. Click on **Open Mail Body Editor**.

    - Enter **Your order**
    - Select **material** from the `salesorderDetails`. 
    - Enter **has been rejected**.
    - Click on **Apply**.

    <!-- border -->![Mail_3](mail_3.png)  

4. Link your **Send Mail** to **End**.

    <!-- border -->![Mail_4](mail_4.png)  


### Create and configure Process Condition

Once the process with forms is designed, define which process flow should run based on if/else condition criteria.  

1. To add a condition to a process open the Process Builder. Choose **+** next to the Trigger. Select **Controls** then **Condition**.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.png)

2. To configure the condition, choose **Open Condition Editor**.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.1.png)

    > Process content will contain a list of attributes that have been defined in previous skills. For example: in the screenshot, you can see attributes from the API trigger. You will use this process content to configure different skills during business process modelling.

3. Edit your branch condition:

    - Set `orderAmount` from the process content.
    - Select **is greater than**.
    - Enter **100000** as the value.
    - Choose **Apply**.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.2.png)

    You have configured your **if** branch to: **if Order Amount is greater than 100000**.


### Create and configure Auto Approval Notification Form

In this step,you will create a notification form which would be received by supplier if the order is approved automatically with out any approvals.

1. To add the new form, you will use the **Duplicate** feature. Select the **Overview**.
    - Find **Order Confirmation Form** under the Artifacts section and select three dots **(...)**.
    - Choose **Duplicate**.

    <!-- border -->![Duplicate](10.png)

2. In the duplicate artifact pop-up window change the name to **Auto Approval Notification** and select **Duplicate**.

    <!-- border -->![10.1](Autoapproval_1.png)

3. The form is automatically opened in the form builder. Change the Auto approval form in the form builder to reflect the data for auto approval use case.
   
    Design the notification form, the same way as in the previous steps, to send another notification to the  requester about auto-approval.

    Modify the  **Layout fields**:

    | **Form Fields** | **Field Settings with Label** | **Configuration(Read Only)**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Headline 1 | Automatic Order Confirmation | |
    | Paragraph  | Your order has been received and we will send you the details as soon as the order is shipped. You can find the details of your order below, please review and verify your request:| |
    | Paragraph  | Your Sale's Order Details: | |
    | Text |  Material Name  | X
    | Text |  Customer | X
    | Number | Order Amount | X
    | Date | Expected Delivery Date | X
    | Paragraph | Please press the SUBMIT button to acknowledge the order status| |

    
    <!-- border -->![Auto Approval](autoapproval_2.png)

4. **Save** your work.

5. Go back to the Process Builder and add the auto approval form to the **Default** node.

    <!-- border -->![Auto Approval](autoapproval_3.png)

6. Configure the **General** section.
   
    Under Subject:

    - Enter: **Your order**.
    - Choose: **material** from `salesorderdetails`.
    - Enter: **has been approved automatically**.

    Under **Recipients** Enter your login ID(email).

    <!-- border -->![Auto Approval](11.7.png)

7. Configure the **Inputs** section.

    | Form Input Fields| Process Content Entry
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Customer Name | `shipToParty`    
    | Material Name| material
    | Order Amount | `orderAmount`
    | Expected Delivery Date | `expectedDeliveryDate`

    <!-- border -->![Auto Approval](11.8.png)

8. Connect the outgoing flow of the **Auto-approval Notification form** to the **End** activity.

    <!-- border -->![Auto Approval](11.10.png)

### Save the project    

 Click on **Save** to save your work.

Once you have successfully completed project ,your final process looks as below.

<!-- border -->![Final Process](FinalProcess.png)

 This completes the process design with condition criteria that will decide what process flow is executed and whether there will be an auto-approval or a one-step approval route.
 Now the business process is ready to integrate with SAP Build Apps.
