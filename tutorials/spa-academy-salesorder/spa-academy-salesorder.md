## Intro
With the new citizen automation user experience, you will get access to a new scope of opportunities for running your day-to-day workflows. In this tutorial, you will learn how a low-code and no-code tool can help you build the apps you need at the speed your business demands, using visual drag and drop tools for application development.

There are many use cases where you can make a difference using SAP Build Process Automation. During this tutorial, you will see how the Sales Order Approval process can be built using forms where a sales order is a document which confirms a sale that is generated by the seller after receiving a purchase order from the buyer. These sale order requests have to be reviewed and approved by the supplier to ensure that the sales orders are delivered on time. Once approved or rejected, the requester will be notified.

10. **Save** your work.

    With this you have completed the process design of your business process. You have experienced building a process in a completely no-code environment and with no technical know-how. You used the process builder to create a one-step approval process with the API trigger , approval form and notification forms.


### Create and Configure Process Condition

Once the process with forms is designed, define which process flow should run based on if/else condition criteria.  

1. To add a condition to a process open the **Process Builder**. Choose **+** next to the Trigger. Select **Controls** then **Condition**.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.png)

2. To configure the condition, choose **Open Condition Editor**.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.1.png)

    > Process content will contain a list of attributes that have been defined in previous skills. For example: in the screenshot, you can see attributes from the API trigger . You will use this process content to configure different skills during business process modelling.

3. Edit your branch condition:
    - Set **Order Amount** from the process content
    - Select **is less than**
    - Enter **100000** as the value
    - Choose **Apply**

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.2.png)

    You have configured your **if** branch to: **if Order Amount is less than 100000**.


4. Link your **Default** branch to **Approval Form**.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.3.png)

    With this process condition, only the sales order above a specific amount will be sent for approval and the rest will be auto-approved.    

5.	Decide the process flow if the condition criteria is met. First, you have to remove the connection from If-route to Approval Form and then create a new form to notify the requester of the auto-approval.

    <!-- border -->![Process Condition](11.33.png)
